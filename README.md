Project-4

This project is about restaurant management system using Django.

Objective:
Is to develop a restaurant booking system where external users can reserve tables, and the site owner can manage bookings, ensuring smooth restaurant operations.

Wireframe below is the design I have chosen to build the site. The design is consistent throughout the site. The site has sex pages: Home, About Us, Menu, Booking, contact us and login.

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you, so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public, you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.
